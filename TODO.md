# TODO

- Continue working on the API side
  - https://www.prisma.io/docs/tutorials/-ohdaiyoo6c#step-5:-instantiate-the-prisma-binding
  - Should the generated prisma file in src be checked into version control?
  - https://github.com/prismagraphql/graphql-config
  - Add vscode folder with plugin recommendations:
    - Styled Components
    - prisma vscode (Called GraphQL)
  - Get typescript set up on API (Then think of adding to client)
  - Look into subscriptions
  - Use GraphQL Shield: https://github.com/maticzav/graphql-shield
- Add custom Apollo install to client with subscription support
  - https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/advanced/boost-migration.html
  - Connect to API
  - Test normal query + live query in sidebar
